# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

en:
  students:
    create:
      success: "Student created successfully."
      failure:
        name: "can't be blank"
  race:
    created: "Race was successfully created."
    updated: "Race updated successfully!"
    deleted: "Race was successfully deleted."
    not_found: "Race not found."
    position_required: "Positions are required for all students."
    invalid_student_data: "Invalid student data. Please try again."
  check_position_service:
    errors:
      start_position: "Position should start with 1"
      invalid_positions: "Invalid positions: Tied athletes must be followed by the correct next position, e.g., 1, 1, 3"
